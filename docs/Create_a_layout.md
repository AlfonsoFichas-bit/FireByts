# Create a layout - Lume
The HTML code generated by the Markdown file in the [the previous step](https://lume.land/docs/getting-started/your-first-page/) is very basic. If you open the `_site/index.html` file, you will see something like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>
  This is my first page using <strong>Lume,</strong> a static site generator for
  Deno.
</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

```


You may be missing some basic HTML tags like `<html>`, `<head>` or `<body>`. This is because Markdown isn't a format designed to build HTML pages, but only the HTML code containing the article or post. You need to use a **layout** to create a fully complete web page.

Create a new directory `_includes` and the file `layout.vto` inside it. The `.vto` extension is for [Vento](https://vento.js.org/): a template engine supported by default by Lume. Add the following code to the file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My first page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>

```


This layout has the `HTML` code needed to build the whole page. The `{{ content }}` tag is a placeholder used to insert page content from `index.md`.

[Assign the layout to the page](#assign-the-layout-to-the-page)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's configure the `index.md` page to use our new layout. We have to create _front matter_: a block delimited by two triple-dashed lines containing [YAML](https://yaml.org/) code. In this block, we define the variable `layout` with the value `layout.vto` (the name of the layout file).

```
---
layout: layout.vto
---
# Welcome to my website

This is my first page using **Lume,**
a static site generator for Deno.

I hope you enjoy it.

```


Lume will compile the Markdown code and use the `layout.vto` file as the page layout.

Note

The directory `_includes` is a special directory that Lume understands. You don't need to include it in the `layout` variable.
